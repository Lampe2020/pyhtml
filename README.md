# ryggrad
A web engine written purely in Python.   
It's the backbone (Swedish: "ryggrad") of a web browser. Yes, I'll be making my own pure-python web browser, which I'll 
call "skalle" (Swedish for "skull"), as the skull rests and relies upon the backbone. Oh, and of course (it's written 
in Python) it'll be very slow, so you might have to wait till there's only the skull left of you for big pages to load.
